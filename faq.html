          The Aim of this research is to develop a Smart Building prototype in real time operational environment at
          by applying Complex Event Processing and Analytics to perform data aggregation, co-relation,
          learning and temporal analysis for the optimized building operations as shown in the modules section of this website.

          <br/>
          Presently buildings are equipped with lighting, heating, air conditioning, elevator control, security
          systems along with fire and smoke detection and other necessities. All these systems are manual
          driven and operating in silos at the cost of building spaces, resources, energy and cost effectiveness.
          Smart buildings promise to enhance efficiency, through interconnection of all these systems in a cost
          effective way.

          Development of Smart Grids and Smart Cities are the two highly motivated ongoing projects of
          Government of India. Both of these projects are facing difficulty to adjust with the existing
          infrastructure and significant upgradation of existing infrastructure is required to cope up these
          projects.

          In future smart buildings will be in a high demand to cater smart grids which are aiming to establish
          energy-efficient infrastructure thus as an outcome of proposed research a building could quickly able
          to regulate temperature, illumination, ventilation and audio visual needs in accordance with the
          occupancy patterns

          IIIT Allahabad has recently installed a roof top solar power generation plant on the roof of boys hostel
          to generate 300 KW electricity. Nearly it is also planned to install another 300 KW rooftop plant
          along with 940 solar panels and 10 invertors and connect it to the power grid. The generated solar
          energy could also be integrated in the vision of smart building and an energy efficient environment
          could be established

          <br/>
        Smart buildings equipped with sensors and electronic devices as a Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) offer great research perspective to explore communication, computation and controlling of physical devices by using real time Complex Event Processing (CEP) and analytics.

        In the present research, a model for real time CEP and analytics have been proposed for Smart-Building at IIIT Allahabad, India. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The research will also highlight the strength, weakness, and challenges addressed in the proposed system.

          What are the Implementation arrangements proposed for the project ?
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
        The project prototype will be initially implemented and tested at IIIT Allahabad. Later it can be to
        deployed to any similar organization as per the specific needs of the system. A big data analytics lab
        is already set up under the supervision of project investigator to facilitate hardware and software
        platforms for data analytics and complex event processing. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The project investigator is having a
        research group of 3 Ph.D. Scholars, 4 post graduate students and approximately 10 teams of under
        graduate students and all are enthusiastic to be the part of this proposed research proposal.
